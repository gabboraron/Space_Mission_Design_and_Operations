> Space exploration is truly fascinating. From Sputnik to Apollo, followed by the assembly and exploitation of the International Space Station and the successful operation of the Hubble Space Telescope and other space observatories, we are uncovering many mysteries of our universe.

## 1.
### Newton laws:
1. In the absence of a force a body either is at rest or moves in a straight line with constant speed.
2. A body experiencing a force $$F$$ will be subject to an acceleration $$a$$ such that $$F=ma$$ where m is the mass of the  body.
3. whenever a first body exerts a force  on a second body, the second body exerts the same amount but inverse direction force.

Generalization of second law: $$p = mv$$

Lorentz factor:
$$\frac{1}{sqrt{1-({\frac{v}{c}})^2}}$$

 
### Gravitation law:
$$F = \frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$

Where $F$ is the force, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ mass of the object 1, $m_2$ mass of object 2, $r$ distance between $m_1$ and $m_2$ masses.
